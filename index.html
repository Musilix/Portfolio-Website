		<div class="h2-holder"><h2>I'm Kareem Shehab</h2></div>
		<p>I am currently a senior and Computer Science tutor over at Georgia State University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Databases and Knowledge Based Systems.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>I've been writing code and dealing with bugs since 2014, and have become fully aware that no matter how much I learn, there always seems to be something new coming out there that it's time to become aquanted with.</p>
		<p>I especially like evolutionary systems and their play in computer science; such as genetic algorithms and machine learning agents. I've used a very helpful library recently for visualizing programs called p5.js in order to create several web-based artificial systems. Some of which are embedded in the site!</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>Although it's not my forte, I also have begun experimenting with networking and real time communications within web-based applications. I've seen some people come up with some really creative things such as messaging apps, collaborative drawing, and just simple multiplayer games all in browser. All of which get my creative juices flowing! As of now though, I'm working on some really interesting things in the field of data mining research at my university, which will hopefully come to provide sufficient means in tackling the current generation's opioid crisis.</p>

	<div id="chimchom2-descriptive">
		<div class="h2-holder"><h2>I'm More Than Just Kareem Though!</h2></div>

		<p>I've worked on various personal projects over my <b><i>4 years of programming</i></b>, ranging from artificial system designs all the way to financial data mining, scalable network applications, and even this website you're on now!</p>

		<p>I am very adept working with <b><i>Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Linux, mySQL, PHP, and Assembly Language for x86 Processors</i></b>, along with some other things I am relatively adequate with such as <b><i>C, C++, Node, React, and Shell Scripting</i></b></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>To get a bit more specific, here's a nice synoptic list of projects I've had the most fun and learned the most with!</p>

		<ul>
			<li id="collapsable1"><img src ="./Images/rainbow (1).png" width="80" height="80"></li>
			<li id="collapsable2"><img src ="./Images/bars-chart.png" width="80px" height="80px"></li>
			<li id="collapsable3"><img src ="./Images/robot.png" width="80px" height="80px"></li>
			<li id="collapsable4"><img src ="./Images/server.png" width="80px" height="80px"></li>
		</ul>

		<div id="actual_collapsable1">
		    <p>I'd have to say one of the most fun and enriching projects I took on was building an evolutionary algorithm in a manner that conveyed optimization in a great way. Here, I told my computer I wanted the perfect DOUBLE rainbow... and my computer sought to give me this! Through genetic algorithms the program I made was able to utilize biological concepts suchs as genetic mutation, gene splicing, and the elemental workings of "survival of the fittest" to find perfect double rainbows in 1/8^8 times the speed of other brute force algorithms!</p>

		</div>
		<div id="actual_collapsable2">
		    <p>For some reason this summer, I started to become very interested in data visualization and the influence it could have on deducing or noticing significant patterns. I did very basic things, by using just JSON files of birds and flowers, but by doing so, I began to notice abundant detail in just simplisitic visualization. It really got me interested, and has been pushing me further working with data. Although I don't have a complete, concise idea yet, I know my next endeavour will span further from just static data; utilizing interesting APIs out there</p>
		</div>
		<div id="actual_collapsable3">
		    <p>I spent my spring semester of college in 2018 working on a robot! Admittedley, it was probably one of the most difficult processes I had ever come to work on; just because I've become so accustomed to the software aspect of computer science. Nonetheless! I truly do believe that no matter how horrible that spring was, I came out knowing much more than I ever could have when dealing with robotic software, middleware, hardware, and all the likes!</p>
		    <p>I'm speaking on how hard and excrutiating the experience was for me, but I didn't seem to give any discrete detail! Looking past the hard times, I really had to come to appreciate the final product: a robot that utilized computer vision to determine shapes, edges, and colors, made use of sonar sensors for obstacle avoidance, and had a basic NN that helped in path finding.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="actual_collapsable4">
		    <p>Just recently I was again struck with a random urge to jump onto something that had never even passed my mind priorly... For some reason, I wanted to learn more about Node. And I did! Not just that, I came to learn about many of the frameworks and libraries out there that make Node even better, such as socket.io, paper.js, express, and many others!</p>
		    <p>It was a really fun experience working with all these new things, and ultimately I made a really cool little messaging web app where people could come - FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLDWIDE WEB - and send messages to anyone in the server</p>
		    <p>By no means do I consider it complete, and I plan to add more and more features even though there are many many many... many better messaging apps out there. It's a great learning experience, and even if my program isn't the best, it is still UNIQUE!</p>
