		<p>I'm a recent graduate from Georgia State University, earning a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a concentartion in yada yada... You know the spiel. That's what LinkedIn is for. I'd rather this be a more laid back place, yeah?</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>I've been writing code and dealing with bugs since 2014, and even after all this time, it still comes to bring me joy. If that's not the epitome of passion and dedication, I don't really know what is.</p>
		<p>Specifically, I've come to be extremely interested in real world machine learning applications, quantitative data analysis, and web programming. Even further, I LOVE the intermingling of all these fields, as I believe it is a great means for demo'ing the capabilities of ML to anyone who has access to the internet!</p>
		<p>I especially appreciate the capabilities of NLP models as well as Reinforcement Learning Models and Evolutionary Systems. The way that they come to imitate the biological composition of our universe intrigues me further than any other field I've come across. I believe that creating systems which mimic our worlds natural environment can not only come to be somewhat entertaining, but really informative on the dynamics of our world itself.</p>
		<p>I believe Artificial Intelligence has grown further from the bounds which were originally set for it, and ultimately will come to do a lot of things which no one really anticipated for it. I am all for that and hope to be on the forefront of this new wave of technology and insight.</p>

		<br><br>
		<p>I spent a lot of my time in college acting as a teaching assistant, tutor, and teacher in various subjects involving math, high level & low level programming languages, and theoretical concepts of computer science, and I still hold pride in this although some may not see it as significant as an internship at some big company. I came to learn about myself and what comes with being able to convey things in a meaningful and entertaining manner. And I believe this skill is just as important as learned industry knowledge!</p>

		<p>I've worked on various personal projects over my <b><i>4 years of programming</i></b>, ranging from genetic algorithms all the way to conducting research in data mining, software development, and even this website you're on now!</p>

		<p>I am very adept working with <b><i>Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, mySQL, PHP, and Assembly Language for x86 Processors</i></b>, along with some other things I am relatively adequate with such as <b><i>C, C++, Node, React, and Shell Scripting</i></b></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>To get a bit more specific, here's a nice synoptic list of projects I've had the most fun and learned the most with! [just clicc an icon]</p>

		    <p>I wouldn't be able to get by without listing the project that first introduced me to AI. Being blunt, I was in the most boring AI class that I think could have existed, learning about heuristics, pathfinding methods (shout out to A*), fuzzy sets, and adversarial searches. Honestly, it probably isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be. I was a young chitlin back then anyway, what did I know. Looking back on it, although the class may have been a bit terse, it definitely was enlightening.</p>
			<p>Without this class, I may not have jumped into AI as I did. Speaking on that, I have to say one of the most fun and enriching projects I took on was in this class, building an evolutionary algorithm in a manner that conveyed optimization in a great way. Here, I told my computer I wanted the perfect DOUBLE rainbow... and my computer sought to give me this! Through genetic algorithms the program I made was able to utilize biological concepts suchs as genetic mutation, gene splicing, and the elemental workings of "survival of the fittest" to find perfect double rainbows in 1/8^8 times the speed of other brute force algorithms!</p>
			<p>Why though... is this junk even important?! Well, take a look at NASAs use of it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_antenna">HERE</a>, where it was used to create the most optimal spacecraft antenna. Just LOOK AT IT... what HUMAN WOULD THINK OF THAT? Let me tell you - no one. The use of such an algorithm provides solutions which we would of never even imagined that actually can come to be more optimal than anything we thought.</p>

		<div id="actual_collapsable2">
				<p>For one semester during my junior year I was lucky enough to work on some research alongside my Data Mining Professor, Yubao Wu, where I was assigned with working on a subsection that dealt with extracting large amounts of data (in the form of Google Plus posts) and applying various probabilistic models and NLP concepts to classify posts as bad or good. Bad being a post which seemed to be trying to solicit illicit materials, such as opioids. The overall project was heavily focused around the opiod epidemic which is still ongoing, and aimed to extract meaningful patterns in an unsupervised manner from these posts.</p>
				<p>I think this was the moment when I began applying a lot more complex concepts form the ML field, much more intense than the genetic algorithm I had made a year prior. It was a great learning experience and I came out with a lot of knowledge on the various forms of encoding text, sentiment analysis, and Bayes Theorem.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="actual_collapsable3">
			<p>I think a lot of the most meaningful projects I've worked on came around during my senior year; I had grown a considerable amount from when I first started my freshman year. One notable project was from my Deep Learning course, where me and some friends set out to build a model which used CNNs as well as a dataset created by us in order to decode ASL hand gestures in real time. We did the full end to end process of collecting data(images of ASL gestures), analyzing any possible statistical significance in our data, and going on to apply our model on our data, tuning our hyperparameters thereafter... and then tuning them again... and then one more time.</p>
			<p>If you wanna see a small demo, I posted a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egmvIorx184">YOUTUBE</a> back when I was testing out the models capabilities to distinguish between two semi-similar ASL gestures - B and Y.</p></p>
		</div>

		<div id="actual_collapsable4">
			<p>Another one of my most meaningful projects, even more meaningful than my Deep Learning project had to be the one... the only... Software Engineering Course Project.</p>
			<p>This was the only class during uni where I got a grasp on how computer science can actually be applied in the real world, learning the end-to-end process from requirement illicitaion, system design, implementation, testing, and ultimately maintenance. Me and a group of friends did all this in the time span of 3 months, creating a full fledged transport alert app that aimed to simplify the daily life of a commuter by offering various real time data on local buses and trains.</p>
			<p>We worked with various APIs as well as various front-end and back-end languages to bring about a fully functioning app hosted on an AWS EC2 server - no h8 google, fb, and micro :-/ </p>
			<p>I would link to it here, but our free trial ran out and we had to begin paying to host our site there, so I think you know where this is going</p>
		</div>

		<div id="actual_collapsable5">
			<p>I'd like to lastly bring up an endeavour I've taken on outside of school, just for a change of pace. Not all my significant projects are in school, okay?! I just like my school studies is all.</p>
			<p>Whenever I get on Youtube, which just so happens to be a lot of times, I always tend to see several videos that I want to watch. Being the person that I am, I open a new tab for each video to "watch later", but somehow this leads me to have some 15 extraneous tabs open by the end of the week filled with videos I never "watched later". Yeah I know I can add it to my watch later playlist but that thing is already littered with trash videos from the brunt of my high school and early college days... and I just don't feel like sorting it out or even creating a new playlist for that matter.</p>
			<p>I want to simply be able to QUEUE MY VIDEOS UP! Youtube, you have queueing functionality on your TV app, "WHY CANT I HAVE IT ON THE WEB APP?!", I scream. Well, no matter, I worked to create my own queue functionality in a packaged chrome extension. Now I have the capability to easily add, remove, and switch up a personal queue of videos I want to watch.</p>
			<p>What is it called, you say? I call it... <a href="https://github.com/Musilix/QueueTube">QUEUETUBE</a>! Creative, eh?</p>
