		<div class="h2-holder"><h2>I'm Kareem Shehab</h2></div>
		<p>I am currently a senior over at Georgia State University, pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Databases and Knowledge Based Systems.</p>
		<p>I've been writing codes and dealing with bugs since 2014, eat my ass</p>
		<p>And I especially like evolutionary systems and their play in computer science; such as genetic algorithms and machine learning agents. I've used a very helpful library recently for visualizing programs called p5.js in order to create several web-based artificial systems. Some of which are embedded in the site!</p>

	<div id="chimchom2-descriptive">
		<div class="h2-holder"><h2>Who am I Though?</h2></div>
		<p>I've worked on various personal projects over my <b><u>4 years of programming</u></b>, ranging from artificial system designs and web server construction/management all the way to this website you're on now!</p>

		<p>I am very adept working with <b><u>Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Linux, mySQL, PHP, and Assembly Language for x86 Processors</u></b>, along with some other things I am relatively adequate with such as <b><u>C, C++, and Shell Scripting</u></b></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>To get a bit more specific, here's a nice compiled list of projects I've had the most fun with and learned the most with!</p>

		</ul>
		<div id="actual_collapsable1">
		    <p>I'd have to say one of the most fun and enriching projects I took on was building an evolutionary algorithm in a manner that conveyed optimization in a great way. Here, I told my computer I wanted the perfect DOUBLE rainbow... and my computer sought to give me this! Through genetic algorithms the program I made was able to utilize biological concepts suchs as genetic mutation, gene splicing, and the elemental workings of "survival of the fittest" to find perfect double rainbows in 1/8^8 times the speed of other brute force algorithms!</p>
